# The AVR Folder
## Time of Active Development (2016-2018)
back in the days where Arduino UNO (c) and AVR micros were extremely available and popular (that is, before Microchip acquired Atmel messing up the whole non-ARM landscape of microcontrollers), i started making some project using C and AVR-ASM (which is **not** GNU-AS, even though i discovered that GNU-AS has such a wonderful support for AVR Assembly). Again, Bless this Mess, as some of the project include Circula Buffers and Inerrupt-Driven USART communication, as far as Reading from an old IDE-HDD drive.  
It is to say that the usage of structures was quite a taboo for my programming, back in the days!

Please, remember that these projects were created using Atmel Studio 5.0, generally for ATMega 32 / 328p, with intrusion by some Attinys. Some of the code is already compiled.
